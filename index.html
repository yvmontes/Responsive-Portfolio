        <p>Hi, my name is Yvette and I am a Front-End Developer located in the greater Los Angeles 
        area of Southern California. </p>

        <p>I have always had a passion for web development, at a young age I taught myself basic HTML 
        and CSS. When I went to high school I continued to take intro classes in web design and graphic 
        design. I strayed away from it for some time, but after graduating from university and spending 
        some time abroad, I knew that web development was my calling. </p>

        <p>I have experience with programs such as Adobe Dreamweaver, Adobe Photoshop, and Adobe
        Illustrator.</p>        
        
        <p>My goal as a web developer is to create simple and modern responsive designs for the use of 
        others.</p>
